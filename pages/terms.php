                            These terms and conditions govern your use of my services as a freelance web developer. By using my services, you agree to be bound by the following terms and conditions.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">1. Services Provided</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            I provide web development, design, maintenance, and consulting services based on the specific needs of the client. The scope of work will be defined in an agreed-upon contract or project proposal.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">2. Project Timeline</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            All project timelines and deadlines will be discussed and agreed upon in writing before the start of the project. Delays caused by the client (such as late feedback or unresponsiveness) may extend the timeline accordingly.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">3. Payment Terms</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            Payments for services will be agreed upon in advance. Typically, a deposit may be required before work begins, and the remaining balance will be due upon project completion or at agreed-upon milestones. All payments must be made within 20 days of receiving the invoice.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">4. Revisions and Changes</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            Minor revisions are included in the agreed-upon price, as long as they are within the scope of the original project proposal. Any significant changes or additional work requested by the client will be billed at an hourly rate or as agreed upon.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">5. Client Responsibilities</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            The client agrees to provide all necessary information, content, and materials required for the completion of the project in a timely manner. The client is responsible for reviewing and approving work throughout the development process.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">6. Intellectual Property</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            Upon final payment, the client will receive ownership of the website, design, and related content created as part of the project, unless otherwise agreed. I reserve the right to display the work in my portfolio or use it as a case study.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">7. Limitation of Liability</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            I will not be liable for any indirect, incidental, or consequential damages arising from the use of the delivered website or services. Any issues related to third-party services, such as hosting providers or domain registrars, are the responsibility of the client.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">8. Termination of Agreement</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            Either party may terminate the agreement if the other party breaches any of the terms outlined in the contract. Upon termination, the client agrees to pay for any completed work up to that point.
                        </p>

                        <h2 class="fw-bolder mb-3 color-ck-dark">9. Governing Law</h2>
                        <p class="lead color-ck-dark text-muted mb-4">
                            These terms and conditions shall be governed by and construed in accordance with the laws of [your country or region]. Any disputes arising from these terms shall be resolved through arbitration or in the courts of [your region].
                        </p>
